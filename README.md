## Introduction
This repository shows our initial experiments on using images of the conjunctiva to predict the Hemoglobin (Hb) levels of a person. Since Hb scores are the gold standard in determining anemia, and the threshold for anemia varies from region to region, we aim to assist medical professionals by giving them Hb scores so that they can make the best judgement. Our major aim is to provide accessibility to patients in remote areas where primary medical care cannot be reached instantly. This will help detect anemic patients in a timely manner and thus help save lives.
